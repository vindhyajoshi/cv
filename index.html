  <h1>Manik Prabhu</h1>
  <p><em>Indian Hindu saint, philosopher, poet, mystic and <strong> Guru </strong>.</em></p>
  <p> Prabhu's philosophy, the "Sakalamata Siddhanta" basically rests on the principles of Advaita Vedanta as propagated by Adi Sankara. Shri Prabhu strongly advocated the essential oneness of all religions. Prabhu's Muslim Devotees revered him as an
    incarnation of Mehboob Subhani whereas his Lingayat devotees saw him as a form of Basavanna. Shri Prabhu composed numerous Bhajans and Padas in various languages such as Marathi, Kannada, Hindi, Urdu and Sanskrit. Shri Prabhu was also associated
    with the First war of Indian Independence in 1857.[3][4] Shri Sai Baba of Shirdi, Shri Swami Samarth of Akkalkot, Shri Bramhachaitanya of Gondavale and many other contemporary saints are believed to have visited Maniknagar to interact with Prabhu
    on matters of deep spiritual wisdom.[5] All biographers refer to Shri Prabhu as a saint of great spirituality and mysticism. Shri Prabhu's teachings basically lay stress on the path of Bhakti. Alongside, he moralizes in the most remarkable manner
    on the 'Vedantic Truths' concerning the 'spiritual unity' of beings. Manik Nagar is the place where he took Sanjeevani Samadhi. Shri Prabhu's Samadhi at Maniknagar is the nucleus of Manik Nagar and acts as the spiritual center of the activities
    of Shri Manik Prabhu Samsthan.</p>
